#tp in Mega Evo Guru and Korrina
<...> Oh?
<...> You must be @p, then. Sycamore told me you would be coming.
<Mega Evolution Guru> I'm called the Mega Evolution guru. I guess you could say I'm an acquaintance of his.
<Mega Evolution Guru> Oh, but Mega Evolution guru isn't my real name, of course.
<Mega Evolution Guru> Now, come here for a moment, will you?
<Mega Evolution Guru> Hm? Only one of you? I thought he gave five kids a Pokédex.
<Mega Evolution Guru> Isn't there anyone else with you?

<Trevor> Oh!
#tps Trevor, Tierno in
<Tierno> Who's that you're talking to, @p?

<Mega Evolution Guru> People call me the Mega Evolution guru!
<Tierno> Uh, my name is Tierno.
<Tierno> And that's @p over there.
<Trevor> My name is Trevor.

<Mega Evolution Guru> Pleased to meet you, Sycamore's pupils! But there are still only three of you, huh?
<Mega Evolution Guru> What's this, now? Were you the one who found that Intriguing Stone?
<Mega Evolution Guru> Well, who found it doesn't really matter.
<Mega Evolution Guru> What's important is that you were honest.
<Mega Evolution Guru> If you tell lies, the truth is clouded and eventually lost...
<Mega Evolution Guru> And while we're being honest, that Intriguing Stone is just an ordinary rock.
<Mega Evolution Guru> Hm? Sure a lot of hubbub out there.
<Mega Evolution Guru> Does that mean everyone has arrived?
#Mega Evolution Guru tps out

<Korrina> Hey there! So you made it to Shalour City!
<Korrina> Lucario is in its Poké Ball, but it's really happy to see you!
<Korrina> Well, we should go see what's going on, too!
#Korrina and everyone tps out

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://youtu.be/tfg-ki20hdY?t=822

<Mega Evolution Guru> Hmm! Looks like everyone is finally here.
<Shauna> @p!
<Serena> Where have you been?
<Trevor> It feels like it's been some time since our whole group has gathered in one place.
<Tierno> Yeah. I think it's been since we met up on Route 7.
<Tierno> Mr. Mega Evolution Guru... I've been wondering this whole time. Who is that over there?

<Mega Evolution Guru> This is my granddaughter Korrina. She's Shalour City's Gym Leader.
<Mega Evolution Guru> So, Sycamore's pupils. Now that you're all here...
<Mega Evolution Guru> I suppose I should explain Mega Evolution to you.
<Mega Evolution Guru> I assume you all know about Pokémon Evolution?

<Shauna> I know! I know! Um...
<Shauna> You have your Pokémon battle a lot, and then they grow stronger and evolve!
<Shauna> Oh, and there are Pokémon that evolve with certain items. ♪

<Serena> Some Pokémon evolve through friendship, and others only evolve in certain places.

<Korrina> Exactly! And it's likely that Pokémon evolve in a lot of other ways as well!
<Korrina> But Mega Evolution is an Evolution that transcends all other Evolution!

<Mega Evolution Guru> Indeed! Mega Evolution is a transformation of Pokémon that were thought to be unable to evolve any further!
<Mega Evolution Guru> It's a whole new level of power!

<Trevor> So in an Evolutionary line like Charmander, Charmeleon, and Charizard...
<Trevor> Does that mean Charizard would be able to evolve even further?

<Korrina> Yep! Exactly right! But not all Pokémon have a Mega Evolution.

<Mega Evolution Guru> There's a reason why I used the word “transformation” a moment ago.
<Mega Evolution Guru> Mega Evolution differs from Evolution because it ends after a certain amount of time.
<Mega Evolution Guru> In other words, it's a temporary Evolution.

<Shauna> What?! It evolves, but then it goes back to what it was before?

<Korrina> Yes... Mega Evolution is a special kind of Evolution.
<Korrina> That said, we still know very little about it.
<Korrina> What we know now is that it requires special items.
<Korrina> And the most important element is the trust between Pokémon and Trainer.

<Serena> Trust... In other words, the bond between Trainer and Pokémon!

<Mega Evolution Guru> To make Mega Evolution work, you need two items:
<Mega Evolution Guru> a Mega Stone for the Pokémon and the Mega Ring, which has a mysterious stone set in it, for the Trainer.
<Mega Evolution Guru> Since Professor Sycamore entrusted each one of you with a Pokédex, I would like to give these items to all of you...
<Mega Evolution Guru> I'd like to share them with you, but...

<Shauna> But? But what? Just come out and say it already!

<Mega Evolution Guru> Sorry, but presently, I have only one Mega Ring...
<Mega Evolution Guru> It's a very precious item. That's why my research isn't getting anywhere...
<Mega Evolution Guru> So, I want all of you to decide among yourselves which one of you will be the one who challenges the Mega Evolution successor.

<Tierno> I'll pass. Pokémon battling isn't really my scene.
<Tierno> So, Mega Evolution would be way out of my league.

<Shauna> Me, too! It really would be a cool memory, and it does look interesting, but...

<Trevor> I want to complete the Pokédex first.
<Trevor> If you try to do too much at once, you won't accomplish anything.

<Shauna> So that leaves @p and Serena, then.

<Tierno> Trainers don't get much better than you two.

<Serena> @p, let's battle for it!
<Serena> Whatever the reason, a battle gives us an opportunity to compete and see who Vaniville Town's best Trainer really is!
<Serena> I will master Mega Evolution and set myself apart from other Trainers.
<Serena> I'll also do it for my Pokémon--we've come so far together, and they never stopped believing in me, their Trainer.
<Serena> You and your Pokémon are stronger... I can tell just by looking at you.
<Serena> But I will not lose. No... I'm going to win!

#Post-battle Serena in Tower of Mastery

Ending dialogue: So... I lost, then.

<Serena> It was so strong! I could feel how powerful the bond between you and your partners is.
<Serena> Losing is frustrating, but... You will definitely be able to Mega Evolve your Pokémon!

<Korrina> There may be winners and losers in a Pokémon battle.
<Korrina> But I really thought you two and your Pokémon were all winners!
<Korrina> Mega Evolution is nothing more than just one way to make Pokémon stronger.
<Korrina> There are many Trainers who bring out the strength of their Pokémon without Mega Evolution.

<Mega Evolution Guru> Well then, @p! First, you should challenge Korrina, the Gym Leader.
<Mega Evolution Guru> I'm excited to see what the two of you will accomplish with the power of Mega Evolution!

<Korrina> Pokémon need a Mega Stone! And Pokémon Trainers need the Mega Ring!
<Korrina> Well, my mysterious Trainer, my Lucario may have taken a shine to you,
<Korrina> but now I must test you to see if you're ready to challenge the Mega Evolution successor!
<Korrina> I'll be waiting for you at the Gym! Oh, the rest of your friends should come challenge me at the Gym, too!
#Korrina tps away

<Serena> I'll bet the professor will be happy if you master Mega Evolution.
<Serena> That's one way you can show mastery as a Trainer.
#Serena tps away

<Shauna> Well, that's what the professor wanted us to do, after all!
<Shauna> He said we should aim to be the best Trainers we can be and enjoy our journey!

<Trevor> Tierno. Shall we work to be the best Trainers we can be, too?

<Tierno> All right then! Let's aim for the top!
<Tierno> Hope to see you again soon, @p! See ya, Shaunee!
#Trevor and Tierno tp away

<Mega Evolution Guru> You don't really need to go to all the trouble of comparing--every living creature is unique.
<Mega Evolution Guru> But still, having someone to compete against and aim for greater heights with is a very fine thing.

<Shauna> @p, I think that you and Serena are going to compete against each other and get really strong!
<Shauna> I'm so glad we're all traveling together! ♪

#swap trainer and npc?
Chatting NPC dialogue:
I'm very curious to see the results of my research. To use the ultimate weapon to cleanse this world once and for all... It's fascinating!

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://youtu.be/iRlJssYKSig?t=1474
#Team Flare Blockade

Nope! I can't hear them! I won't listen to the Pokémon's cries!
So the ultimate weapon can only be powered with the life energy of Pokémon...
I can't let you go beyond this point! A kid like you shouldn't be exposed to such sights.
The mysterious stone is absorbing energy...


Um? Where was the entrance to our secret HQ again? Was it in a boulder?
Only Team Flare's stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
I bought a new life for $5,000,000!
It's an ancient artifact?

<Editor-in-chief> On the XXth day of the XXth month at the Pokémon Day Care on Route 7
<Editor-in-chief> About the extraordinary power that Volcanion is said to possess.
<Editor-in-chief> Discussed it with a top Breeder who's very familiar with the ecology of Pokémon and drew the following deduction.
<Editor-in-chief> In order to cause a steam explosion powerful enough to blow up mountains,
<Editor-in-chief> the Pokémon must have an organ with extremely high temperature that can instantly vaporize water to steam.
<Editor-in-chief> That kind of organ is unheard of in the ecology of Pokémon, but Volcanion may have it...
<Editor-in-chief> Is there another part of the memo you're interested in reading?

[In the fog]
<Editor-in-chief> On the XXth day of the XXth month at the Pokémon Center in Camphrier Town Interviewed a Trainer,
<Editor-in-chief> who says he witnessed a Pokémon that could be Volcanion when he was stranded in a mountain.
<Editor-in-chief> According to the Trainer, a huge Pokémon's shadow appeared suddenly.
<Editor-in-chief> Two huge armlike limbs that could crush even the land extended from its back,
<Editor-in-chief> and from their tips, something that looked like smoke belched out and made the fog around the Pokémon even thicker.
<Editor-in-chief> The Trainer said the Pokémon's shadow slowly disappeared into the fog.

[A nation-building...]
<Editor-in-chief> On the XXth day of the XXth month at Café Kizuna in Lumiose City In the southern part of the Kalos region,
<Editor-in-chief> there seems to be a custom to revere Volcanion as a nation-building Pokémon.
<Editor-in-chief> People seem to believe that a steam explosion caused by Volcanion created the plain where they live.
<Editor-in-chief> As a matter of fact, a huge mountain range suddenly disappeared,
<Editor-in-chief> due to an unexplained explosion in that part of the region in the past...

No way! Could that be the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa that you have there with you?
Oh, I was mistaken? Sorry about that...
Whoaaa! I can't believe it's true! See, I travel around the world, trying to solve its many mysteries.
I've been researching supernatural events that have occurred over the last 100 years. One thing I've found is that the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa is connected to many of these strange events! I've also managed to come across some information about the mysterious power that Hoopa appears to wield.
So, without further ado, I'd like to share my findings with you! After all, you're actually traveling with Hoopa--the very subject of my research!
You've come back! Do you want to know something about Hoopa?
What would you like to know about Hoopa?
Its mysterious rings
The secret of its lair
Its deeds and exploits
Nothing
It's said that Hoopa can use the power of the three rings it adorns itself with to move objects about as it pleases... That's not all! I've also heard that when Hoopa unleashes its full power, the size of the rings can grow up to multiple miles in length! With such massive rings, apparently it can transport even entire islands!
It's said that Hoopa's lair is overflowing with the objects and treasures it nabbed over the years, claiming them for its own. Rumor has it that there are mountains of gold and silver treasures that it took from ancient kings and wealthy land barons. I hear that Hoopa's lair is in an oasis in the desert, but no one's been able to find the place!
There's a tale about an organization that tried to manipulate Hoopa's power for their own benefit. After a while, certain objects that belonged to the organization mysteriously began to disappear. Everything from weapons and vehicles to money... It all began to vanish one by one. The organization got scared and decided to hole up inside of their headquarters. Once they did, things stopped disappearing! Just like that! Relieved that it was finally over, the organization finally decided to step outside. It was then that they discovered their headquarters had been transported wholesale to somewhere in the middle of a desert! Terrified of what they had unleashed, the organization promptly disbanded.
Just say the word, and I'll share my knowledge with you.
Whether Hoopa becomes a trustworthy partner or ends up bringing about great misfortune depends entirely on the Trainer. I hope you don't forget that.
I think Hoopa'll turn out right as rain with you at its side, though! You look like a Trainer who knows how to take care of h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon and treat 'em right. Well, I hope you end up having lots of fine adventures with Hoopa! Have fun!
Is there anything else you'd like to know?
The Pokémon called Hoopa is linked to many of the unexplained supernatural events that have occurred in this world. My search for Hoopa has led me to this library.

<Looker> @p! I have received a tip from the children.
<Looker> I judge it most important, and it may be of use to you.
<Looker> Mimi apparently doesn't like being petted by strangers.
<Looker> It is imperative that you check the alleys where Mimi is known to stroll around.
<Looker> To be precise: Across from the Galette Stand! Across from Lumiose Station!
<Looker> Right next to Café Triste! The entrances to these alleys are all found on North Boulevard!
<Looker> Au revoir and out! I wish you luck!

EXPANSION SUIT SPECS 1. Physical Enhancement Heightens physical abilities of the wearer with built-in muscle-enhancing technology. 2. Poké Ball Jack A hacking cable on the neck piece allows the wearer to upload a computer virus to Poké Balls and override their systems. This provides access to control the Pokémon. The virus also magnifies the Pokémon's power.
3. Surface Texturing Optically disguises the wearer, based on the current understanding of Kecleon and Ditto's physical transformations. 4. Remote Control Remote control of the suit protects against the risk of its wearer going renegade. AI personalities are preprogrammed, modeled on common Trainer types. When the suit is controlled remotely, the wearer's consciousness is suppressed. The wearer experiences a coma-like state.

Expansion Suit Field Trials Secret Records: Volume 1 The XXth day of the XXth month... Posted an advertisement for part-time work at the Lysandre Café to recruit a test subject for the suit's field trials. The Expansion Suit should make even an average Trainer into a superhuman force, a force to be reckoned with... It is the ultimate result of my life's study-- my magnum opus. The trials must be a success! I wait on the appearance of a young, healthy, and ambitious test subject.

https://youtu.be/azyrTT_H1E8?t=1272
Expansion Suit Field Trials Secret Records: Volume 2 The XXth day of the XXth month... At long last, a response came to my advertisement for part-time work. The subject's name is Emma. She is a healthy girl, 16 years of age. When I attempted to explain the intent of my research, she gave little sign of understanding. She does appear to understand the passion I have put into the suit research, and she showed interest in continuing with the trials. Now that Team Flare has been disbanded, my funds are running severely low.
I hired her on the spot. The trials must proceed with no time lost. First, I'll measure Emma's physical and mental abilities to ensure she can complete the trials. The XXth day of the XXth month... I have customized the suit to better fit Emma's frame. The XXth day of the XXth month... I have designated the code name Essentia to be used when Emma is wearing the Expansion Suit.

https://youtu.be/azyrTT_H1E8?t=1333
Expansion Suit Field Trials Secret Records: Volume 3 The XXth day of the XXth month... As we make final preparations for the trials, a new trouble strikes. I have learned that Emma has no experience as a Pokémon Trainer! With little other choice, I am forced to instruct the girl on all the basics.

https://youtu.be/azyrTT_H1E8?t=1342
Expansion Suit Field Trials Secret Records: Volume 4 The XXth day of the XXth month... Finally, the trials are underway. The first trial is designed to test the suit's physical capabilities. Using the texturing function, the subject has infiltrated the closely guarded art museum and left an insignia on a historical mural.
The remote-control function has worked without complications thus far. Emma shows no ill effects from her time in the suit. Her memory is blank. When questioned, she describes her experience as “taking a nap.” Perhaps I will give her a bonus in celebration of this successful trial.

Expansion Suit Field Trials Secret Records: Volume 5 The XXth day of the XXth month... Trials begin of a key part of the Expansion Suit: the hacking cable I've called the Poké Ball Jack. With the texturing function enabled, the subject battles Trainers around the city. She then collects the Poké Balls from Trainers she defeats, so that we may use them in our tests. The results of the tests have been quite favorable thus far. However, these trials have not been entirely free from incident. Some apparent acquaintances of Emma's are proving to be a hindrance to our progress.
Among these acquaintances is a [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl who appears to be the new Champion, but this is not yet confirmed. We encountered a glitch in the remote-control programming, and I lost control for a brief period. Fearing possible effects on Emma, I suspended the trials temporarily. When we returned to the secret base, I examined the girl for signs of damage, but she appeared to be unharmed. She still retains no memories from her intervals in the suit. The one thing she admitted was experiencing “a frightful dream.”
